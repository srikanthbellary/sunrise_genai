I have registered a new company called Sunrise Gen AI LLC. Company is registered in Florida. 
The purpose of our company is to :
1. Build Gen AI enabled cutting edge mobile apps and web services.
2. Create Gen AI based media like Voice Overs (T2S), Posters (T2I), Advertisements(T2V) and short films (T2V).
3. Take up Gen AI consulting work for any other companies or enterprises.

I have also secured the domain names sunrisegen.ai and sunrisegenai.com to launch our company's website.
I have also generated a logo for our company and put it at the root of this project folder: 
C:\Users\bells\Documents\Tero\Sunrise_GenAI\sunrise_gen_ai_logo_enhanced.png

I want you to build a website for me with this backgorund information and use the Logo to infer the theme and color palette for the website.

The website should be very simple like couple of pages:
- Home Page or Landing Page
- About Us Page
- Contact Us Page
- Gen AI Mobile Apps page
	- Apps we built or building:
		1. LabelSaber.com - an Intelligent Ingredient Analyzer App enabled with AI and Computer Vision OCR Mobile app.
		2. Swaram.ai - an Intelligent AI Voice Companion Mobile App
		3. Lensort.com - an Intelligent Photos and Documents organizer mobile app.
- Gen AI Multimedia Page 
	- MultiMedia we created:
		1. Apocalyptic Roulette - An AI Short Film depicting various extinction level events into a uniform story line.
		2. No Planet For Humans - An AI Short Film depicting the risks of Sentient AI and dystopic future.
		3. Arcane Legacy - An AI Short Film created in 48 hours for RunwayML's "Gen:48 Short Film Festival"
- Gen AI Consulting Page
	- Contains list of Consulting or contracting work we are working on.
		1. No consulting work yet but coming soon.

Though the websie will be minimal like have a few pages of content to be displayed, I want you to push the limits of Generative AI capabilities to showcase what can be acheived with Gen AI in website building.

I want you to use cutting edge tech stack and create compelling visuals to prove that we are a really a GEN AI based company. It will not look good when we say we are a Gen AI company and the website is bland like basic wordpress site. I want the users to be shocked when they look at our website because the website itself should proof of how advanced we as a Sunrise Gen Ai company are and the website should also showcase our Gen AI capabilities. 

I want to host this website with minimal cost wherever I get very cheap server/VM space. We can think about deployment to the server later. But we are on a windows laptop and lets get through the development of the website first. 

Also I really liked the Logo we have generated for our company. I want you to adhere to the logo color palette and neon based themes to reflect the cutting edge, futiristic advanced GEN AI capabilities.
